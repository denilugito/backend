Features
Express.js: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for scalable and flexible data storage.
Mongoose: Elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.
CORS: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing support to connect with ReactJS front end.
JWT Authentication: JSON Web Token for secure authentication.
Dotenv: Zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.
Prerequisites
Node.js (v14 or later)
MongoDB (v4 or later)
Installation
Clone the repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Install dependencies:

sh
Copy code
npm install
Set up environment variables:

Create a .env file in the root directory and add your MongoDB URI and any other necessary configuration:

env
Copy code
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-uri
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
Start the server:

sh
Copy code
npm start
The server will start on the port specified in your .env file (default is 5000).

Usage
To use this backend with your ReactJS front end, ensure your React app makes HTTP requests to the API endpoints defined in this project. You can use libraries like axios or the Fetch API for making these requests.

API Endpoints
Here are some of the main API endpoints provided by this backend:

User Routes:

POST /api/users/register - Register a new user
POST /api/users/login - User login
GET /api/users/profile - Get user profile (protected route)
Data Routes:

GET /api/data - Get all data
POST /api/data - Add new data
PUT /api/data/:id - Update data by ID
DELETE /api/data/:id - Delete data by ID
